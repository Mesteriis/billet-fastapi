# Code Review Checklist

This checklist ensures consistent code quality and proper documentation across the project.

## üìã Pre-Review Automated Checks

Before manual review, ensure all automated checks pass:

- [ ] `make check-docstrings` - Docstring language and format check
- [ ] `make lint` - Code formatting and linting
- [ ] `make typecheck` - Type checking with mypy
- [ ] `make test` - All tests pass
- [ ] `make check-imports` - Inter-app import validation
- [ ] `pre-commit run --all-files` - All pre-commit hooks pass

## üìù Documentation Review

### ‚úÖ Docstring Requirements

**For API Modules (src/apps/\*/api/, src/core/, src/tools/)**:

- [ ] All docstrings are in **English**
- [ ] Follow **Sphinx format** with proper sections
- [ ] Include **Args** section with parameter types and descriptions
- [ ] Include **Returns** section with return type and description
- [ ] Include **Raises** section for potential exceptions
- [ ] Include **Example** section with practical usage
- [ ] API routes include **curl examples** and **response examples**

**For Classes and Functions**:

- [ ] Class docstrings describe purpose and main functionality
- [ ] Method docstrings explain what they do, not how
- [ ] Public methods have complete documentation
- [ ] Private methods (`_method`) have brief descriptions if complex

**Exceptions**:

- [ ] Simple `__init__.py` files (exports only) - no docstrings needed
- [ ] Entry points (`main.py`, `cli.py`) - simple one-liners only
- [ ] Test files - brief descriptions only

### ‚ùå Documentation Red Flags

- [ ] **Russian text in API docstrings** (–∞–≤—Ç–æ–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ—Ä—è–µ—Ç—Å—è)
- [ ] Missing docstrings in new public APIs
- [ ] Vague descriptions ("Does stuff", "Helper function")
- [ ] Missing parameter documentation
- [ ] No examples for complex functions
- [ ] API routes without curl examples

## üèóÔ∏è Code Architecture Review

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

- [ ] New features have corresponding tests

- [ ] No `# type: ignore` without justification
- [ ] Generic types used appropriately

## üìä API-Specific Checklist

### New API Endpoints

- [ ] **Curl examples in docstring** showing request format
- [ ] **Response examples** showing expected JSON structure

- [ ] Logout invalidates tokens properly

## üöÄ Feature Completion

- [ ] Edge cases handled appropriately
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Database migrations if needed

### Bug Fixes
